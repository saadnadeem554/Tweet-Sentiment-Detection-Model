# Tweet-Sentiment-Detection-Model

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to recognize emotions in tweets. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets into different emotion categories.

## Overview

Emotion recognition from text is an important task in sentiment analysis and natural language processing. This project aims to classify tweets into various emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc., using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled tweets with corresponding emotion categories. The data was preprocessed to remove noise, such as URLs, mentions, and non-alphanumeric characters.
